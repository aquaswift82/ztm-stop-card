# Lovalace custom stop card for ZTM - Warsaw public transport information
This Lovelace custom card displays Warsaw Public Transportation (ZTM) line information departing in the near future from a configurable stop sensor.

This custom card depends on the ZTM - Warsaw public transport sensor that you may find at https://github.com/peetereczek/ztm.

Lovelace UI does not support custom sensor attributes natively, thats why you need to use custom card for pretty output in our UI.
Inspired by BKK Stop Card (https://github.com/custom-cards/entity-attributes-card) and Entity Attribute Card (https://github.com/custom-cards/entity-attributes-card)
